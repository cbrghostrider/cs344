First install OpenCV from the instructions on the web.

---------------
Project Properties:
C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories -> <include path here> e.g. C:\opencv\build\include
Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories -> <lib path here> e.g. C:\opencv\build\x64\vc16\lib
Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies -> <dll name here> e.g. opencv_world490d.lib

-------

Some constants have been deprecated. Google the names and change to the corresponding cv::<name>
e.g. cv::IMREAD_GRAYSCALE, cv::IMREAD_COLOR, etc.


------------

For some reason, HW1.cpp is included in main.cpp! 
Therefore in the solution/project, don't add this as an existing item.
------------

After these changes, the solution should build.
